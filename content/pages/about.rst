I am a Robertson Fellow in Biomedical Data Science at the
`Big Data Institute <https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/>`_, `University of
Oxford <http://www.ox.ac.uk/>`_. I develop algorithms and software
to tackle difficult problems in large-scale genomics, integrating
with the Python data science stack.

Activities
**********

- I contribute to the `sgkit-dev <https://github.com/sgkit-dev>`_
  GitHub organisation, including leading work on the `VCF Zarr paper
  <https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giaf049>`_ and associated
  `bio2zarr <https://sgkit-dev.github.io/bio2zarr/intro.html>`_
  and `vcztools <https://github.com/sgkit-dev/vcztools>`_ utilities.

- I lead development of `tskit <https://tskit.dev/tskit/>`_, the
  tree sequence toolkit. Tskit is a Python and C API that allows us to
  work with genealogical histories at unprecedented scale.

- I also lead development of the `msprime
  <https://tskit.dev/msprime>`_ coalescent simulator, which is based on
  tskit, and can simulate of the exact coalescent with recombination over
  chromosome-sized regions with hundreds of thousands of samples.

- I co-organised Probabilistic Modelling in Genomics 2022 conference.
  Please see the `ProbGen22 website <https://probgen22.github.io/>`_
  for more details.

- I'm a member of the `PopSim Consortium <https://github.com/popsim-consortium>`_
  and lead development of its first product,
  `stdpopsim <https://popsim-consortium.github.io/stdpopsim-docs/stable/index.html>`_.

- I'm part of the `Data Working Group <http://ga4gh.org/#>`_ in the `Global
  Alliance for Genomics and Health <http://genomicsandhealth.org/>`_ (GA4GH).
  I am currently participating in the design and `client side implementation
  <https://github.com/jeromekelleher/htsget>`_ of the `htsget data access protocol
  <http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/htsget.html>`_.

- During my postdoc in theoretical population genetics , I worked primarily
  on a new model for populations evolving in a `spatial continuum
  <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01019.x/full>`_.
  During this time I developed two Python simulation packages: one to
  simulate a `general form <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ercs>`_ of the model
  and another to simulate a more `specialised form
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/discsim>`_ much more efficiently.

- I found some bugs in `TAOCP <http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html>`__
  volume 4A while it was still in beta-test fascicle form. I am therefore a
  proud saver at the `The Bank of San Serriffe
  <http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/boss.html>`__!
